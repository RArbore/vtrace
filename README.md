# vtrace
vtrace is a high detail voxel renderer. vtrace will use path tracing to render voxel geometry with complex lighting effects.

vtrace is still in early development. It is built in Rust and C, and uses Vulkan ray tracing extensions for rendering. The world generation and engine logic will primarily be handled in Rust, and the Vulkan rendering operations primarily in C.

vtrace is free / libre software licensed under the GPL v3.0.

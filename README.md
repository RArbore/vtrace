# vtrace
vtrace is a high detail voxel renderer. vtrace will use path tracing to render voxel geometry with complex lighting effects.

vtrace is still in early development. It is built in Rust and C, and uses Vulkan ray tracing extensions for rendering.

vtrace is free / libre software licensed under the GPL v3.0.
